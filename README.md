ifit.html - a webpage that generates an audio file (wav format) that can adjust the levels of my CSAFE equiped Elliptical Machine (NordicTrack CX-938).  This doesn't use the CSAFE protocol only tones.
serial-comms.cpp - with the correct wiring (and a MAX3232) this will communicate with a piece of Fitness Equipment using the CSAFE protocol.
